# Guardinas-of-the-Galaxy-Character-Sheet-App

## Description
My app is website where you can add your favourite Guardians of the Galaxy Characters. You can assign the images you want, and you are also free to assign your favourite quotes, weapons, etc. You also have the option to edit the characters that are already present on the webpage if you prefer, or add new ones that have joined the team in recent years. I won't spoil the 2nd and 3rd movie for you if you haven't watched it.

## Planning and Problem Solving

This is my plan and design for my app.

## Cool Tech
I used Flask and the programming language python to create my web page. I went for a neat and clean css style for my project. Where everything was organised and neatly aligned. I went a bit artsy on the colour spectrum of my website, choosing colours like puprle to represent space, as the characters are in space most of the time. I also chose other colours to stand out against the purple background, like aqua, yellow and fluroscent green (lime green), as in the movies, the director loves to use a lot of colours.

## Bugs to Fix
I think the only bug I would like to fix is the images size. In my website, I had to carefully pick and choose images that actually showed thier faces, which meant choosing images from google that had a cetain length and width. For example, I initially had a full body potrait of Star Lord, which had too much length, and the only thing the web page shows is the bottom half of his body and not the top half. This means that if my user decides to add certain images, they might not show the whole image, so they would have to do trial and error on the images to see which one fits nicely. I wish I could have added a feature that would let you choose which part of the image you wanted to show in the webpage, like almost drag the picture within the frame to display the part of the image you want.

## Lessons Learnt
The lessons I learnt was to make sure to be consistent with the label names, for example, if I named my template file comment, then when I refer to it in my other pages, make sure to refer to it by typing comment, not comments. So make sure you are linking the right pages, otherwise when you run the app, it will show an error like 404 url not found.

## Future Features
If I could keep woirking on this, i would add more features to my app, for instance I would have a like button so my users can like their favourite character on the app, as well as a search bar where they can search for their characters.
